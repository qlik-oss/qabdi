Customer’s exclusive remedy and Qlik’s sole liability with regard to any breach of this warranty will be, at Qlik's option and expense, to either: (i) repair or replace the non-conforming Software; (ii) if the Software was obtained by purchase (and not as a result of a conversion from a previously purchased Qlik Product), refund to Customer the fees paid by Customer for the non-conforming Software; or (iii) if the Software was obtained as a result of conversion from a previously purchased Qlik Product, require the Software to be uninstalled by Customer and reversion to the prior Qlik Product.

3.3. Qlik will have no liability for any warranty claim, or any obligation to correct any defect or problem with the Software, to the extent that it arises out of: (i) any use of the Software not in accordance with the Documentation; (ii) any unauthorized modification or alteration of the Software; or (iii) any use of the Software in combination with any third-party software or hardware not specified in the Documentation.

6.3. Indemnification.  Qlik shall defend, indemnify and hold Customer harmless from any damages and costs awarded against Customer as a result of a third party claim that the Software, as delivered by Qlik, infringes upon any third party copyright, trademark or a patent (“IP Claim”).  Customer shall defend, indemnify and hold Qlik harmless against any third party claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against Qlik alleging that Customer’s external use of the Qlik Products pursuant to Section 1.2 infringes upon any third party copyright, trademark or patent to the extent any such infringement arose from the Customer’s combination of the Qlik Products with any data, services or software not provided by Qlik (“Customer Claim”).  Each party’s indemnification obligation is subject to: (i) prompt notification of a claim in writing to the indemnifying party; (ii) consent to allow the indemnifying party to have sole control of the defense and any related settlement negotiations; and (iii) provision of information, authority and assistance as necessary for the defense and settlement of the IP Claim or Customer Claim.

6.5. Remedies.  If the Software becomes, or, in Qlik’s opinion, is likely to become, the subject of an IP Claim, Qlik may, at its option and expense, either: (i) obtain the right for Customer to continue using the Software in accordance with this Agreement; (ii) replace or modify the Software so that it becomes non-infringing while retaining substantially similar functionality; or (iii) if neither of the foregoing remedies can be reasonably effected by Qlik, terminate the license(s) for the subject Software (without need for a ruling by a court or arbitrator) and refund as applicable a pro rata portion of prepaid subscription fees, or license fees amortized over three (3) years on a straight-line basis, provided that such Software is returned to Qlik promptly after the effective date of any such termination.

6.6. SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY.  THIS SECTION 6 STATES QLIK’S SOLE AND ENTIRE OBLIGATION AND LIABILITY, AND CUSTOMER’S AND ITS AFFILIATES’ SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE RIGHT AND REMEDY, FOR INFRINGEMENT OR VIOLATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

Each Party will hold in confidence the other Party’s Confidential Information and will not disclose or use such Confidential Information except as necessary to exercise its express rights or perform its express obligations hereunder.  Any Party’s disclosure of the other Party’s Confidential Information may be made only to those of its employees or consultants who need to know such information in connection herewith and who have agreed to maintain the Confidential Information as confidential as set forth herein.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may disclose the other Party’s Confidential Information to the extent that it is required to be disclosed in accordance with an order or requirement of a court, administrative agency or other governmental body, provided that such Party, to the extent permitted by law, provides the other Party with prompt notice of such order or requirement in order that it may seek a protective order.  Each Party’s confidentiality obligations hereunder will continue for a period of three (3) years following any termination of this Agreement, provided, however, that each Party’s obligations will survive and continue in effect thereafter with respect to, and for so long as, any Confidential Information continues to be a trade secret under applicable law. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Qlik Products and all pricing information shall be treated as the Confidential Information of Qlik.  Customer will maintain reasonable access controls and system security to safeguard the Qlik Products.

8.1. Term.  This Agreement shall become effective as of the date the Parties execute an Order Form and shall remain in effect until terminated (i) as set forth in Section 8.3 below, or (ii) automatically upon expiration of all rights to use any Qlik Products pursuant to one or more Order Forms.  Unless otherwise specified in a Statement of Work, either Party may terminate any Consulting Services for convenience upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the other Party.

8.2. Renewal.

8.2.1. Support.  Support shall automatically renew for additional annual Support Terms unless Customer provides Qlik with written notice of non-renewal at least forty-five (45) days prior to the end of the then-current Support period.

Qlik may terminate this Agreement if Customer terminates or suspends its business without a successor or becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors.  If Qlik Products are purchased through an Authorized Reseller, Qlik may terminate any right to use the Qlik Products pursuant to this Section in the event Qlik fails to receive payment for such Products.

Termination of this Agreement or any licenses shall not prevent either Party from pursuing all available legal remedies, nor shall such termination relieve Customer’s obligation to pay all fees that are owed.  All provisions of this Agreement relating to Qlik’s ownership of the Qlik Products, limitations of liability, disclaimers of warranties, confidentiality (for the time periods specified in this Agreement), waiver, audit and governing law and jurisdiction, will survive the termination of this Agreement.
